##  How to Do Drag and Drop

### Step 1: Track Where the Object Is

Make an object called `bob` to store its position and size:

```js
let bob = {}
```

- in `setup()`, we give it values for `cx`, `cy`, and `width`, `height`, `isHit`.

---

### Step 2: making a generic hitbox box to detect When the Mouse Is Over the Object

To know when the mouse is inside a rectangle, we use a custom function `hitBox()` to check if the mouse’s position is inside the object’s area. If it is, we return an answer `true`, or `false`.

```js
function hitBox(cx, cy, w, h) {
// the math will be different if you are in rectMode(CENTER)
  if (mouseX > cx-w / 2 && mouseX < cx+w / 2 &&  
      mouseY > cy-h / 2 && mouseY < cy+h / 2) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

 - Just to give visual feedback: if the mouse is over the shape, change the fill color to red.

### Step 3: Use `mouseDragged()` to Move It

The `mouseDragged()` function is built into p5.js. It runs whenever the user drags the mouse.

We use it like this:

```js
function mouseDragged() {
  let check = isHit(bob.cx, bob.cy, bob.w, bob.h)// this returns true only if hit
  
  if (check) {
    bob.cx = mouseX
    bob.cy = mouseY
  }
}
```

That means: **only move the object if the mouse was already over it when dragging started.**

---

* `isHit` checks if the mouse is touching the shape.
* `mouseDragged()` moves the shape to the current mouse position.
* This allows you to “grab” the object by clicking on it and move it around.
