## Part 1: Written Work (5 points)

On **line 1** of your code, answer these four questions using comments (`//`).

1. **What is a function?**
   What does a function do in p5.js, and why is it useful? Give an example using a built-in p5.js function (like `ellipse()`, `text()`, or `mousePressed()`).

2. **Function Components:**

   * **Parameters:**
     What are parameters? How do they help functions be more flexible? Give an example of a function with parameters.

   * **Arguments:**
     What are arguments? How do arguments relate to parameters? Show an example of calling a function with arguments.

   * **Local Scope:**
     What does it mean when a variable has local scope? Why might that be useful?

   * **Global Scope:**
     What does it mean when a variable has global scope? Why might that be a concern?

   * **Return Value:**
     What is a return value in a function? When would you use one? Give an example of a function that returns a number or string.

## Part 2: Math with Functions (2 points)

Write three functions that use math to calculate and return values. Use `print()` to show the results in the console.

### 1. Circle Area
Formula: `a = πr²`
Write a function named `circleArea`
* Call it with different `radius` values.

### 2. Sphere Surface Area

Formula: `S = 4πr²`
Write a function named `sphereSurfaceArea`
* Test it by calling it with different values.

### 3. Sphere Volume
Write a function named `sphereVolume`
Formula: `V = (4/3)πr³`


* Again, test it with different `radius` values.

## Part 3: Drawing with Functions (4 points)

Create a drawing using **custom functions**. Each function should draw one thing (like a tree or sun), and take `cx`, `cy` as coordinates. No hardcoded positions allowed inside the function!

### Requirements:

* Write **3 functions** that draw different shapes (e.g., `drawSun`, `drawTree`, `drawHouse`).
* Each must use `cx`, `cy` as input parameters.
* All drawings must happen *inside functions*,  **no drawing commands in `draw()`** except the function calls.

### Example drawing (done very poorly):

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);

  drawSun(mouseX, 100, 50);
  drawHouse(100, 250, 150, 100);
  drawTree(300, 250, 30, 80);
}

function drawSun(cx, cy, r) {
  fill(255, 204, 0);
  ellipse(cx, cy, r * 2, r * 2);
}

function drawHouse(cx, cy, w, h) {
  fill(150, 75, 0);
  rect(cx, cy, w, h); // base
  fill(200, 0, 0);
  triangle(cx, cy, cx + w, cy, cx + w / 2, cy - h / 2); // roof
}

function drawTree(cx, cy, w, h) {
  fill(100, 50, 0);
  rect(cx - w / 4, cy, w / 2, h); // trunk
  fill(0, 255, 0);
  ellipse(cx, cy - h / 2, w * 2, h); // foliage
}
```

## Reminders:

* Code must be neat and commented where appropriate.
* Use `cx`, `cy` so your shapes are **movable and reusable**.
* All visuals must be drawn using functions only.
