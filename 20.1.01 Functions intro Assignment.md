20.1.01 Functions intro Assignment
```


## Part 1: Written Comprehension (5 points)
on line 1 of your code write the answers to these questions using comments 
1. **What is a function?**  
   Describe what a function is in p5.js and why functions are useful. Provide an example from p5.js to support your explanation.

2. **Describe each of the following components of a function:**

   **Parameters:**
   - What are parameters, and how are they used in a function? Give an example of a function with parameters in p5.js.

    **Arguments:**
   - What are arguments? How do arguments relate to parameters? Provide an example of a function call that passes arguments to a function.

    **Local Scope:**
   - What is local scope in the context of functions? How does it affect variables defined inside a function?

    **Return Value:**
   - Explain what a return value is in a function. Why might you want to use a return value? Provide an example where a function in p5.js returns a value.

## Part 2: Math with Functions (5 points)

Create a function that calculates the area of a circle. The formula for the area is `π * r²`, where `r` is the radius of the circle. In your code:

1. Write a function `calculateCircleArea(radius)` that returns the area of a circle given the radius.
2. Call this function with different values of `radius` and display the result in the console using `print()`.

## Part 3: Drawing with Functions (10 points)

Create a simple scene using functions in p5.js. You should:

1. Write at least **three different functions** that draw shapes (e.g., a tree, a sun, or a house).
2. Use **parameters** to control the size and position of the shapes in your functions.
3. each function needs to only use `cX`, `cY`. This way it can be drawn anywhere on the screen without changings how it looks. No hard coding numbers for shapes.

For example:
- A function to draw a circle (like a sun) with parameters for `x`, `y`, and `radius`.
- A function to draw a rectangle (like a house) with parameters for `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`.

Example Code:

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}


function draw(){
  background(220);

  drawSun(mouseX, 100, 50); // Draw a sun at position (mouseX, 100) with radius 50
  drawHouse(100, 200, 150, 100); // Draw a house at position (100, 200) with width 150 and height 100
  drawTree(50, 250, 30, 80); // Draw a tree at position (50, 250) with a width of 30 and height of 80
}

function drawSun(mouseX, cy, r) {
    fill(255, 204, 0);
    ellipse(mouseX, cy, r * 2, r * 2);
}

function drawHouse(cx, cy, w, h) {
    fill(150, 75, 0);
    rect(cx, cy, w, h); // Draw house base
    fill(200, 0, 0);
    triangle(cx, cy, cx + w, cy, cx + w / 2, cy - h / 2); // Draw roof
}

function drawTree(cx, cy, w, h) {
    fill(100, 50, 0);
    rect(cx - w / 4, cy, w / 2, h); // Draw trunk
    fill(0, 255, 0);
    ellipse(cx, cy - h / 2, w * 2, h); // Draw foliage
}
```

#### Requirements:
- Your code should include at least **three functions** to draw different elements.
- Each function should accept parameters for positioning and size.
- Use `setup()` and `draw()` appropriately.
