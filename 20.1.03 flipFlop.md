## Part 1: Making Flag Variables

More practice with **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**.

Pay close attention to how the line `isCircle = !isCircle;` flips the value of `isCircle`:

* If it was `true`, it becomes `false`.
* If it was `false`, it becomes `true`.

This is called **toggling a flag variable**.

---

### Model

```javascript
// Model
let isCircle = true;  // Start with circle being true
```


### View

```javascript
// View
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(220);

    if (isCircle) { // this is the same as isCircle === true... but lazier 
        ellipse(width / 2, height / 2, 100, 100)
    } else {
        rect(width / 2 - 50, height / 2 - 50, 100, 100)
    }//end of if
}

// Placeholder for future logic if needed
function drawShape() {
    
}
```

---

### Controller

**This is the edit we need to make in this file:**
When we press `'a'`, we need to update the model by changing the value of `isCircle`. This way the view switches between a circle and a square.

```javascript
// Controller
function keyPressed() {
    if (key === 'a') {
        isCircle = !isCircle;  // Flip the value: true becomes false, false becomes true
        //notice we do not draw in the controller
    }
}
```

## Part 2: New and Improved WASD Movement, now with Collision Detection
You are going to make a sprite move using WASD keys and check if it runs into a target shape. When it does, the model will **change shape or color**, but **only once** — it shouldn't keep changing every frame while overlapping.


### **To do:**
1. **Create a `sprite` object** in the Model section:
   It should store at least the following:

   ```js
   let sprite = {
       cx: 100,
       cy: 100,
       shape: "circle",
       colour: "blue"
   }
   ```

Here’s your updated version with clearer language, improved formatting, and better support for teaching purposes. I've also filled in the skeleton code and clarified the purpose of `movement()` and `distance()` functions.

## Part 2: New and Improved WASD Movement with Collision Detection

You are going to make a sprite move using WASD keys and detect when it collides with a fixed shape. When a collision happens, you will change the **model's** shape or color — but it should only happen **once**, even if the sprite keeps overlapping.

---

### 1. **Create a `sprite` object**

In the **Model** section, define a sprite that tracks its position, shape, and color:

```js
let sprite = {
    cx: 100,
    cy: 100,
    shape: "circle",
    colour: "blue"
};

let hasCollided = false; // this will prevent the collision logic from triggering multiple times
let targetX = 300;
let targetY = 300;
```

---

### 2. **Move the sprite using WASD keys**

Instead of using `keyPressed()` (which runs once per keypress), we’ll create a custom `movement()` function and call it inside `draw()`. That way, the movement happens continuously while a key is held down.

```js
function movement() {
    if (keyIsDown(87)) { // W key
        sprite.cy -= 5;
    }
    if (keyIsDown(65)) { // A key
        sprite.cx -= 5;
    }
    if (keyIsDown(83)) { // S key
        sprite.cy += 5;
    }
    if (keyIsDown(68)) { // D key
        sprite.cx += 5;
    }
}
```

> `keyIsDown()` checks if a key is being held down — unlike `keyPressed()` which only triggers once.

---

### 3. **Create a `distance()` function to check for collisions**

You’ll need a function that calculates how far apart two points are and returns `true` if they’re close enough (within 50 pixels, for example). Use `dist()` to calculate the actual distance.

```js
function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
    let d = dist(x1, y1, x2, y2);
    if (d < 50) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Check for collisions inside the `draw()` function**

In `draw()`, you will:

* Call `movement()` to update the sprite’s position.
* Check if the sprite is close enough to the target.
* If it is, and it hasn’t already collided, update the **model** by changing its shape or color.

```js
function draw() {
    background(220);

    movement(); // call the custom movement function

    // Check for collision only if it hasn't already happened
    if (!hasCollided && distance(sprite.cx, sprite.cy, targetX, targetY)) {
        sprite.colour = "red";
        sprite.shape = "square";
        hasCollided = true; // prevent future changes
    }

    // Draw the target
    fill("gray");
    ellipse(targetX, targetY, 100, 100);

    // Draw the sprite
    fill(sprite.colour);

// Check the shape stored in the model (sprite.shape)
// This determines what the view should draw
if (sprite.shape === "circle") {
    // Draw a circle at the sprite's center position
    // ellipse() draws from the center, so no adjustment needed
    ellipse(sprite.cx, sprite.cy, 50, 50);
} else if (sprite.shape === "square") {
    // Draw a square centered at the sprite's position
    // rect() draws from the top-left corner, so we subtract 25 from cx and cy
    // This keeps the square visually aligned with the circle
    rect(sprite.cx - 25, sprite.cy - 25, 50, 50);
}

}
```
