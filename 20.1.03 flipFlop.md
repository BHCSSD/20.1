## Part 1: Making Flag Variables

More practice with **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**.

Pay close attention to how the line `isCircle = !isCircle;` flips the value of `isCircle`:

* If it was `true`, it becomes `false`.
* If it was `false`, it becomes `true`.

This is called **toggling a flag variable**.

### Model

```javascript
// Model
let sprite= {
        cx: 200,
        cy:200,
        isCircle:true
}  
```


### View

```javascript
// View
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(220);

    if (isCircle) { // this is the same as isCircle === true... but lazier 
        
    } else {
       
    }//end of if
}


```

### Controller

**This is the edit we need to make in this file:**
When we press `'a'`, we need to update the model by changing the value of `isCircle`. This way the view switches between a circle and a square.

```javascript
// Controller
function keyPressed() {



}// end of keyPressed
```
