## TODO
- **Implement MVC Structure**: Organize your code into Model, View, and Controller. (This is basically done for you.)
- **Sprite Movement**: Use the WASD keys to control the sprite. The sprite should move around the canvas freely and wrap around the ends.
- **Draw 4 shapes**: draw 4 shapes, one in each quadrant. Use a polygon, star, square, and circle. Helper functions are at the bottom
- **Shape Collision**: When the sprite runs into a shape, change the shape's color using a variable like `isSquareHit = !isSquareHit`.
- **Counter**: Add a counter at the top to track how many shapes have changed color.

---

## Model
- Store the sprite's position and state of each shape (whether it has been hit or not).
- Track the hit counter to count how many shapes have changed color.

```javascript
let sprite = {};
let shapesChanged = {};
let hitCount = 0;
```

---

## View
- **Setup**: Create the canvas and set up the necessary variables.
- **Draw**: Render the background, shapes, and sprite. Display the hit counter.

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 400);
    textSize(24);
    angelMode(DEGREES);
}

function draw() {
    background(220);
    // Draw shapes, sprite, and counter
}
```

---

## Controller
- **Key Presses**: Move the sprite with WASD keys. Remember we made a better version with `update()` that gets called continuously in `draw()`.
- **Collision Detection**: Check if the sprite collides with shapes. If a collision occurs, change the shapeâ€™s color and update the hit counter. Remember you can use the `dist()` function from p5js
- **Reminder**: In the controller portion you can only update variables, you cannot draw or call `fill()`.

```javascript
function keyPressed() {
    // Move sprite based on WASD input
    // remember this is not our best way to make it continuously move
    }

function checkCollisions() {
    // Update shape color if hit, and increase counter
}
```

---

## HINTS
- Use distance calculations to detect collisions between the sprite and shapes.
- Use logical operators to check if the sprite has collided with any shapes.

## Add Comments
- Make sure to comment on each part of your code, explaining the logic behind your approach.

## Helper functions
```js
function polygon(x, y, radius, npoints) {
    const angle = 360 / npoints; // Calculate angle in degrees   
    beginShape();
    for (let i = 0; i < npoints; i++) {
        const currentAngle = angle * i - 90;
        const sx = x + cos(currentAngle) * radius;
        const sy = y + sin(currentAngle) * radius;
        vertex(sx, sy);
    }
    endShape(CLOSE);
}

function drawStar(startX, startY, sides, color, radius1, radius2) {
    fill(color);
    beginShape();
    for (let i = 0; i < sides * 2; i++) {
        let angle = map(i, 0, sides * 2, 0, 360); // Adjusting for proper orientation
        let r = (i % 2 === 0) ? radius1 : radius2;
        let x = cos(angle) * r + startX;
        let y = sin(angle) * r + startY;
        vertex(x, y);
    }
    endShape(CLOSE);
}

```
