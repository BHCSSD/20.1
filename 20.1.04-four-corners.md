## TODO
1. **Implement MVC Structure**: Ensure your code is organized into Model, View, and Controller. (this is basically done for you)
2. **Find the Quadrants**: Write the `getQuadrant` function to identify which of the four quadrants the mouse click is in, using `mouseX` and `mouseY`.
3. **Change Background Colour**: In the `draw()` function write the `if()` statements to change the background color based on the quadrant returned by `getQuadrant`.
4. **Mouse Clicks**: Use the `mouseClicked` function to call `getQuadrant` and update the `currentQuadrant` variable when the mouse is clicked.
5. **HINT Use Logical Operators**: Make use of logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `===`) to find the quadrant and change the background color.
6. **Add Comments**: You need to comment on your code to explain each part of your logic.


### Model
The only thing `getQuadrant(x, y)` does is find out which quadrant you clicked in. There no drawing at all. Just a few `if()` statements

```javascript
// Model
let currentQuadrant = ""; // Store the current quadrant. This is the only variable you need.


function getQuadrant(x, y) {
    // Fill in the logic to determine which quadrant the mouse click is in
    // Use if, else if statements
    // Return something like "top-left", "top-right", "bottom-left", or "bottom-right". 
}
```



### View
you do not need to change `setup()` only the `draw()`

```javascript
// View
function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 400);
    background(220);
    angleMode(DEGREES);
	rectMode(CENTER);
}


function draw() {
    // Fill in the logic to update the background color
    // Use if, else if statements
    // Change to a unique background color for each quadrant
    // have a unique shape if each quadrant is clicked. rect, triangle, polygon, circle
    
}

```

### Controller

```javascript
// Controller
function mouseClicked() {
  //  call the function to find out which quadrant is clicked
  // update the model variable

}
```
