Takashi Murakami's flowers are like the ultimate pop art icons! These cheerful flowers have bright, rainbow-colored petals with big, smiley faces in the center. Murakami blends anime vibes with traditional Japanese art to create these awesome designs. You’ve probably seen his flowers on everything from T-shirts to huge murals. They’re all about spreading joy but also make you think about how art and pop culture mix.

## Show and tell review
1. How to translate the origin 0,0
2. how to rotate shapes
3. how to isolate rotations using `push()` and `pop()` so only 1 shape is rotated.
4. Draw our flower
5. learn about `arc()`
6. create a function to place a flower where we click with the mouse
7. Make the flower change the number of petals using random. 


```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 600);
  background(50,200,80);
  fill(50, 200, 255);
  rect(0,0,width,450);
  noLoop();

}//end setup


function draw() {

    fill(random(255), 0, random(255));
    strokeWeight(1);
    stroke(0);



    fill("yellow");
    
   
}//end draw


function mousePressed() {
  print(`MouseX: ${mouseX}     MouseY: ${mouseY}`);
} // end mousePressed


```

# Generative art. 
Generative art is a form of digital artwork created through the use of algorithms. Artists design systems, often involving code or mathematical rules, that can produce complex patterns, shapes, and designs. The resulting art is often unpredictable, allowing for a blend of control and randomness, which can produce unique, often mesmerizing visual or auditory experiences. This approach can be used in a variety of mediums, from digital paintings to interactive installations, where the artwork evolves in real time.


## YOU ARE EXPECTED TO STEAL IDEAS FOR THIS PROJECT!!!
Below I will be linking to a playlist of videos showing how to make generative crystals. You **must** steal ideas from these tutorials and apply them to your Murakami flowers. The goal is to move your flowers from being static and un-changing, to being more generative. You only need to go through the "beginner" videos of this playlist, the intermediate and advanced ones are not needed whatsoever. 

- A few notes:
	- in video 2 he adds the SVG library, you don't need to do this. I do not know if it will work the current p5js update.
 	- While you are allowed to steal these ideas, you will need to add comments beside what you "skillfully acquired" and explain what you changed to make it work for your flowers.
  		-  You will not get marks for this if you do not have comments
    	-  tell me what video you got the idea from, provide the link with time stamp, and make sure you clearly explain to me what you changed and how it works in your code.
  	- the more ideas you adapt from the tutorial video 2-9 the higher your mark. Again remember you need **ADAPT**, not just copy and paste.

### Ideas from the videos
- video 2: translate()  push() + pop() rotate() + angleMode()
- video 3: design constraints, determine basic structure of a crystal
- video 4: using random
- video 5: refractor
- video 6: adding a helper.js, drawing polygons, making choices randomly
- video 7: adding on more layers of choice with lines
- video 8: adding circles
- video 9: random combos
