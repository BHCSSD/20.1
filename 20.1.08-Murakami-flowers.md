# 20.1.08 - Murakami Flowers Assignment

## Takashi Murakami's Flowers
Takashi Murakami's flowers are iconic in the pop art world! These vibrant, rainbow-colored flowers feature bright petals with big, smiley faces in the center. Murakami combines anime aesthetics with traditional Japanese art to create these unique designs. You’ve likely seen his flowers on T-shirts, murals, and even luxury fashion. His art spreads joy while also making us think about the intersection of art and pop culture.

Getting the petals working

## Starter Code (p5.js)
```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 600);
  background(50, 200, 80);
  fill(50, 200, 255);
  rect(0, 0, width, 450);
  noLoop();
}

function draw() {
  fill(random(255), 0, random(255));
  strokeWeight(1);
  stroke(0);
  fill("yellow");
}

function mousePressed() {
  print(`MouseX: ${mouseX}     MouseY: ${mouseY}`);
}
```

## Generative Art
Generative art is created using algorithms and code. It involves designing systems that use randomness and rules to produce unique patterns and designs. The goal is to allow for a mix of control and unpredictability, leading to visually interesting results.

### Stealing Ideas for This Project!
For this project, you are **expected to steal and adapt** ideas from the tutorials linked below. The aim is to move your flowers from static drawings to generative designs.

[Generative Art Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRZnpOSgMj3K8AV2I6UldnvTj6d_Zrf0&si=UxIqzgXuN0MoHANZ)

#### Instructions for Using the Tutorials:
- Watch the **beginner-level** videos (videos 2-9). The intermediate and advanced videos are **not required**.
- If the tutorial suggests adding the SVG library (video 2), you **do not** need to do this.
- You must **comment on the code you adapt**, explaining:
  1. **Which video you got the idea from** (include a timestamp and link).
  2. **What you changed** to make it work for your Murakami flowers.
  3. **How your modification works** within your code.
- **Higher marks** are awarded for adapting more ideas from the videos creatively.

## Ideas You Can Adapt from the Videos

- **Video 2:** `translate()`, `push() + pop()`, `rotate()`, `angleMode()`.
- **Video 3:** Design constraints, determining the structure of a generative flower.
- **Video 4:** Using `random()` to modify flower properties.
- **Video 5:** Code refactoring to make the program more organized.
- **Video 6:** Creating a `helper.js` file, drawing polygons, making random choices.
- **Video 7:** Adding layers with lines to create depth.
- **Video 8:** Incorporating circles and additional generative elements.
- **Video 9:** Combining multiple techniques for unique outcomes.

## Grading Criteria

- **Basic Flower Drawing (30%)** – Translating, rotating, and drawing the Murakami-style flower.
- **Generative Features (40%)** – Implementing randomness in petal count, colors, and placements.
- **Code Adaptation (20%)** – Properly commenting on adapted code from the tutorials.
- **Creativity & Presentation (10%)** – Unique and aesthetically pleasing final output.

## Final Notes
- You **must** properly credit the tutorial sources.
- Adapt, don’t just copy—be creative!
- Your final artwork should be dynamic and unique.
