# 20.1.12 - Galilean Moons  

Only for review watch this [YouTube video on rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain), then use the concepts from the video to recreate the rotations of Jupiter’s Galilean moons. For accuracy, we will follow the data provided in the [Wikipedia article on Galilean Moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons).

## To-Do:  

Since this unit focuses on functions and parameters, your project will be evaluated based on how efficiently you structure your functions. 

- **The fewer functions you use while maintaining clarity and functionality, the higher your score.** You must have atleast one self made function.  Remeber you can use parameters.
- You are only allowed the global variables provided in the starter code.
- all drawing should be done in your own defined functions. 


1. Draw Jupiter as an ellipse and make it rotate counterclockwise.
   - use the ellipse so i can see a egg shape rotate
   - You don't need to worry about matching the rotation speed to Io’s rotation.
3. Make 3 arrays of emoji faces, one for each moon.
   - as your moons rotate, they need to change faces. 
4. Create your function and draw Io—this will be your reference for the other moons' rotations.
   - make sure it is rotating properly  
6. Add the other two moons:  
   - Ensure Io rotates **twice as fast** as Europa.  (rotation*0.5)
   - Ensure Io rotates **four times as fast** as Ganymede.  
7. **Final 5%**: Add an `if` statement to change the color of juipter when the moons align.
   - this is a mod opperator. Do not stress if you do not get it. 


## starter 
```js
let angle = 0
let io = []
let europa =[]
let ganymede = []

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```
