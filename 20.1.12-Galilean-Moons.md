20.1.12-Galilean Moons
```
**Only for review:** watch this [YouTube video on rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain), then use the concepts from the video to recreate the rotations of Jupiter’s Galilean moons. For accuracy, we will follow the data provided in the [Wikipedia article on Galilean Moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons).

## To-Do:  

Since this unit focuses on **functions and parameters**, your project will be evaluated on how efficiently you structure your functions.

* **The fewer functions you use, while still keeping your code clear and functional, the higher your score.** You must create at least one custom function, and you must use parameters.
* You are only allowed to use the global variables provided in the starter code.
* All drawing must be done within your own defined functions.

  * For clarity: no drawings should be written directly inside the `draw()` function. Instead, you need to create your own functions for everything.

---
### Project Requirements

1. **Draw Jupiter as an `ellipse` and make it rotate counterclockwise.**

   * Use an ellipse so the rotation looks slightly egg-shaped.
   * You do not need to match Io’s actual orbital speed.

2. **Create three arrays of emoji faces, one for each moon.**

   * As the moons rotate, their emoji faces should change.

3. **Write a function to draw Io (reference moon).**

   * Io should rotate correctly.
   * Use this function as the reference for the other moons’ rotations.

4. **Add the other two moons:**

   * Europa should rotate **half as fast** as Io (`rotation * 0.5`).
   * Ganymede should rotate **one quarter as fast** as Io.
   * Add orbital rings to show the paths of the moons.

5. **Bonus (5%):**

   * Complete this only after all previous steps are finished.
   * Create a master slider that controls the rotation speed.
   * The slider must start with no rotation and allow the moons to rotate both forward and backward.
