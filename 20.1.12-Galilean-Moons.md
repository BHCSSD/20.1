# 20.1.12 - Galilean Moons  

Only for review watch this [YouTube video on rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain), then use the concepts from the video to recreate the rotations of Jupiter’s Galilean moons. For accuracy, we will follow the data provided in the [Wikipedia article on Galilean Moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons).

## To-Do:  

Since this unit focuses on functions and parameters, your project will be evaluated based on how efficiently you structure your functions.  

- **The fewer functions you use while maintaining clarity and functionality, the higher your score.** You must create at least one custom function. Remember, you can use parameters.  
- You are only allowed to use the global variables provided in the starter code.  
- All drawing should be done within your own defined functions.  

### Project Requirements:  

1. **Draw Jupiter as an ellipse and make it rotate counterclockwise.**  
   - Use an ellipse so I can see an egg-shaped rotation.  
   - You don’t need to match the rotation speed to Io’s rotation.  

2. **Create three arrays of emoji faces, one for each moon.**  
   - As the moons rotate, their faces should change.  

3. **Create a function to draw Io—this will be your reference for the other moons' rotations.**  
   - Make sure Io is rotating properly.  

4. **Add the other two moons:**  
   - Ensure Io rotates **twice as fast** as Europa (`rotation * 0.5`).  
   - Ensure Io rotates **four times as fast** as Ganymede.  

5. **Final 5% Bonus:**  
   - Add an `if` statement to change Jupiter’s color when the moons align.  
   - This involves the modulo operator. Don’t stress if you don’t get it perfectly.
